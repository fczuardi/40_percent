What's not working:

- Tap Dance for my left shift, `/`, is not super good for typing capital `D`, for example, when typing `~/Downloads`
  - I keep getting `/d`s and `z;`s...

What's working:
- Space as modifier for backspace and enter is not as bad as I feared.

Updates:

- I feel confident having just one Enter now, before I mapped both `;` and `/` on layer 2, now I replaced `;` to be `|` and left only `space+/` for enter.
