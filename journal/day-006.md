What is working:
- having `-` acessible without modifiers is nice
- spacebar as a momentarily layer modifier is nice, feels confortable to activate Esc and Backspace on P and Q borders 
- End is an useful key
- Shift keys on z and / is a good position, tapping term tweaking ir something similar is neede though to make them flawless

What is not working:

- typing ã is super dificult
- I still press up arrow when I mean to go down
- Tapdance tapping term tweaking is not there yet, sometimes 100 feels to little while the default 200 to much
- I'm not sure about the current Super keey position
- having numpad on a layer is nice, maybe make the layer togglable instead of momentarily
- I am not using # and $ as much as a I anticipated, maybe PgUp and PgDown would be a better use of row 4

What I want to try:
- layers that you tap to enter instead of holding,influenced by [this video]([url](https://youtu.be/8wZ8FRwOzhU?si=ojyDCu9oOurO-30q)https://youtu.be/8wZ8FRwOzhU?si=ojyDCu9oOurO-30q)
- 150ms as tapping term for tapdances
- A different setup for ã
